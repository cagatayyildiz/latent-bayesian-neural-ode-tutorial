# Latent Bayesian Neural ODE Tutorial
My lecture notes at [Nordic Probabilistic AI School 2021](https://probabilistic.ai/). The lecture content is under [this notebook](./ODEVAE.ipynb). The notebook may not render well on the browser since it is >15MB. 

- Requires `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `torch`, `torchdiffeq`.
- [This folder](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AoCg_EHL_pqdjvcjQCRKs7sKT8FtDg?e=ADR6k7) contains trained models, rotating MNIST dataset and visualizations (place it in your repo clone).
